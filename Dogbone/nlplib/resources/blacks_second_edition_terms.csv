SOCAGE,"Socage tenure, in England, is the holding of certain lands in consideration of certain inferior services of husbandry to be performed by the tenant to the lord of the fee. ""socage, "" in its most general and extensive signification, seems to denote a tenure by any certain and determinate service. And in this sense it is by the ancient writers constantly put in opposition to tenure by chivalry or kuight-service, where the render was precarious and uncertain. Socage is of two sorts, free socage, where the services are not only certain, but honorable; and villein socage, where the services, though certain, are of baser nature. Such as hold by the former tenure are also called in Glenvil and other authors by the name of ""iberi sokemanni, "" or tenants in free socage. By the statute 12 Car. 2, c. 24, all the tenures by knight-service were, with one or two immaterial exceptions, converted into free and common socage. See Cowell; Bract 1. 2, c. 35; 2 Bl.

SODOMY,"Iu criminal law. The crime of unnatural sexual connection; so named from its prevalence in Sodom. See Genesis, xix"
S III,"Term is often defined in statutes and judicial decisions as meaning ""the crime against nature, "" the ""crimen innominatum"" or as carnal copulation, against the order of nature, by man with man, or, in the some unnatural manner, with woman or with a beast. See Cr. Code Ga. f 4352: Horseman v. People. 168 111. 172, 48 N. E. 304. But, strictly speaking, it should be used only os equivalent to ""pederasty"" that is, the sexual act as performed by s man upon the person of another man or a boy by penetration of the anus. See Zusman v. Veal, 10 Ind. 355, 71 Am. Dec. 331. The term might also, without any great violence to ita original meaning, be so extended as to cover the same act when performed in the same man her by a man upon the person of a woman. Another possible method of unilateral sexual connection, by penetration of the mouth (pene in Orem alii immittcre, vol pene alii tn Orem rec pere) is not properly called ""sodomy, "" but ""fellation. "" That this does not constitute sodomy within the meaning of a statute is held in Harvey v. State, 55 Tex. Cr. App. 199, 115 S. W. 1198; Com. v. Poindexter (ky.) 118 S. W. 943; Lewis v. State, 36 Tex. Cr. R. 37, 35 S. W. 372, 61 Am. St Rep. 831. on the other hand bestiality is the carnal copulation of a human being with a brute, or animal of the subhuman orders, of the opposite sex. It is not identical with sodomy, nor is it a form of sodomy, though THC two terms are often confused in legal writings and sometimes in statutes. See Zusman v. Veal, 10 Ind. 355, 71 Am. Dec. 331. Buggery is a term rarely used in statute, but apparently including both sodomy (in the widest sense) and bestiality as above defined. See Zusman v. Veal, 10 Ind. 355. Tl Am. Dec. 331; Com. v.
